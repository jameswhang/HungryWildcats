## Inspiration
“- What do you wanna eat? - Not sure, you? - Just pick something - No, YOU pick something! - Ugh…” Sounds familiar? (This is me and my girlfriend on every date) It’d be nice if SOMEBODY can make a decision for us. So, we decided to make an app that decides this for us.
## How it works
Enter the amount of money you’re willing to spend, and click the button. That’s it! If you want, you can view all the menus that you can have at a particular restaurant by clicking on a restaurant’s name. The choices are made completely randomly, which makes it more fun!
